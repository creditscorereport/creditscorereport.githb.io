Lenders like banks and credit card companies will look at your credit history when they calculate your credit score, which will show them the level of risk in lending to you. The higher your credit score, the better your chances of being accepted for credit, at the best rates.</p> </span> </span> <p> Your credit score influences your chances of getting:</p> <span> </span> Credit cards , loans and mortgages <span> </span> Car financing <span> </span> Gas &amp; electricity monthly payments <span> </span> Mobile phone contracts <span> </span> Insurance monthly payments <span> </span> Property rentals <span> <h2> Can you check your credit score for free?</h2> <span> <p> You can get your Experian Credit Score without paying a penny, by signing up for a Free Experian Account <br> Your free score will be updated every 30 days if you log in.</p> </span> </span> <span> <h2> How does a credit score work?</h2> <span> <p> Your credit score is calculated whenever you apply for credit, such as a loan, credit card, mortgage, or even a mobile phone contract. How your score is worked out depends on the company you’re applying to – different companies have different methods, so your credit rating may vary between them.</p> </span> </span> <p> Lenders look at your borrowing history and how you typically repay money you’ve borrowed. Usually, they’ll take into account:</p> <i> </i> <p> <span> Information from your credit report</span> </p> <i> </i> <p> <span> Your application details</span> </p> <i> </i> <p> <span> Existing data</span> <br> (e.g. if you’re an existing customer) </p> Get my free score <span> <h2> How’s your Experian Credit Score calculated?</h2> <span> <p> The Experian Free Credit Score runs from 0-999. It’s based on information in your Experian Credit Report – such as how often you apply for credit, how much you owe, and whether you make payments on time.</p> </span> </span> <p> You’ll lose points for having records on your report that may look negative to companies, such as late payments and defaults . You’ll gain points for things that companies usually view positively, such as consistently making payments on time and being on the electoral roll .</p> <span> <h2> What’s good or average credit score?</h2> <span> <p> There’s no ‘magic’ number that will guarantee you approval. And, because <span> different companies may look for different things</span> in their potential customers, you may be refused credit by one and accepted by another. We consider a ‘good’ score to be between 881 and 960, with ‘fair’ or average between 721 and 880.</p> </span> </span> <p> Your free Experian Credit Score can be a <span> useful guide</span> and gives you an idea of how companies may see you, so you can make more informed choices when it comes to credit.</p> <h2> What does your Experian Credit Score mean for you?</h2> <p> <strong> Excellent</strong> <br> 961 - 999</p> <p> You should get the <strong> best credit cards, loans and mortgages</strong> (but there are no guarantees).</p> <p> <strong> Good</strong> <br> 881 - 960</p> <p> You should get most credit cards, loans and mortgages but the <strong> very best deals may reject you.</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Fair</strong> <br> 721 - 880</p> <p> You might get OK interest rates but your <strong> credit limits may not be very high.</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Poor</strong> <br> 561 - 720</p> <p> You might be accepted for credit cards, loans and mortgages but they may have <strong> higher interest rates.</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Very Poor</strong> <br> 0 - 560</p> <p> You’re more likely to be <strong> rejected for most credit cards, loans and mortgages</strong> that are available.</p> <p> Remember, your credit rating isn’t set it stone – it’s a living, breathing thing that can change with certain kinds of financial behaviour. So, it can go up or down over time.</p> Get my FREE credit score <h5> Experian Services</h5> Free Experian Account CreditExpert Statutory Report Log in <h5> About Experian</h5> Why Experian Press Investor Relations Affiliate Careers Responsibilities Modern Slavery Contact us FAQs <h5> Legal</h5> Terms &amp; Conditions Data Privacy Cookie settings Marketing claims <h5> Social &amp; Experian App</h5> Facebook - Like us Twitter - Follow us YouTube - Subscribe <p> &dagger; Experian acts as a credit broker and not a lender in the provision of its credit cards and personal, car finance and guarantor loans comparison services, meaning it will show you products offered by lenders and other brokers.</p> <p> Experian acts independently and although our comparison services shows products for a range of lenders and other brokers it does not cover the whole of the market, meaning other products may be available to you.
